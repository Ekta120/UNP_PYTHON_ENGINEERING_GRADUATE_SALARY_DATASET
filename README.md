# UNP_PYTHON_ENGINEERING_GRADUATE_SALARY_DATASET
This project develops a predictive model to estimate engineering graduates' salaries, leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Gradient Boosting. The model considers factors like educational background, psychological traits, and domain-specific skills to provide insights for better salary structuring and decision-making.
Key features include data organization, transformation, and analysis using Python, with queries and aggregation functions ensuring seamless database management and accurate predictions.
